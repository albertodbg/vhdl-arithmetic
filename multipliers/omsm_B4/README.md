This is the folder for the radix-4 Booth Partial Carry-Save On-the-fly Multispeculative Multipliers, which are constructed with a 4:2 compressors tree and a multispeculative Kogge-Stone adder in the last stage. 
The 16x16 multiplier folder contains all the files, the others just the files that differ per design.
